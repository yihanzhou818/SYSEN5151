# SYSEN 5151 AI Engineering Environment

## Mission

This repository is for SYSEN 5151.

GPT and Codex are development-time AI tools.

GPT is primarily used for:
- understanding course material
- interpreting models
- reasoning about requirements
- planning
- reviewing and explaining results

Codex is primarily used for:
- repository inspection
- implementation
- testing
- code review
- documentation
- Git workflows
- executing relevant skills

Neither GPT nor Codex may bypass the systems engineering process below.

# Mandatory Workflow

Every implementation increment must follow this exact sequence:

LOCATE
→ EXTRACT
→ CONSTRAIN
→ PROMPT
→ GENERATE
→ REVIEW
→ RECONCILE

The order must not change.

## 1. LOCATE

Find the relevant:
- stakeholder need
- function
- requirement
- interface
- constraint
- model artifact

Do not code yet.

## 2. EXTRACT

Extract only the information required for the current component.

Record:
- requirement IDs
- interface definitions
- inputs
- outputs
- dependencies
- acceptance criteria

## 3. CONSTRAIN

Identify:
- allowed libraries
- forbidden dependencies
- API boundaries
- data restrictions
- architecture constraints
- performance constraints

Do not silently invent missing constraints.

## 4. PROMPT

Create a bounded implementation task.

The prompt must identify:
- what to implement
- requirement IDs
- relevant interfaces
- allowed dependencies
- files allowed to change
- acceptance criteria

Store significant prompts in prompts/ or prompt-log/.

## 5. GENERATE

Codex may now implement the bounded task.

Modify only necessary files.

Do not add unrelated features.

## 6. REVIEW

Review generated work against:
- requirements
- interfaces
- constraints
- tests
- unintended behavior

Use appropriate Codex skills when useful.

## 7. RECONCILE

Compare the implementation back to the system model and requirements.

Identify:
- assumptions
- model/code mismatches
- requirement gaps
- interface mismatches
- necessary model updates

Code execution alone does not mean the task is complete.

---

# Source of Truth

Before implementation, inspect when relevant:

SPEC.md
requirements/
model-artifacts/
existing interfaces
existing tests

Do not invent requirements.

If information is missing or ambiguous, explicitly identify the gap.

# AI Tool Roles

## GPT

Use GPT primarily for:
- conceptual reasoning
- requirements interpretation
- systems thinking
- architecture discussion
- prompt preparation
- review support

## Codex

Use Codex primarily for:
- reading the repository
- using Skills
- implementation
- running tests
- reviewing code
- Git operations
- documentation

---

# Skills

Codex may use installed Skills when relevant.

Skills do not override this workflow.

Every skill-assisted implementation must still follow:

Locate
Extract
Constrain
Prompt
Generate
Review
Reconcile

---

# Python Environment

Backend:
backend/

Python:
3.12

Virtual environment:
backend/.venv

Activate with:

source backend/.venv/bin/activate

Backend framework:
FastAPI

---

# Safety and Scope

Never commit:
- API keys
- passwords
- credentials
- secrets
- private data

Do not modify unrelated files.

Do not add dependencies unless justified.

---

# Testing

Tests must trace to requirements whenever possible.

After implementation:
1. run relevant tests
2. inspect failures
3. verify requirement coverage
4. reconcile implementation with requirements

---

# Git

Prefer small, traceable commits.

When requirement IDs exist, include them in commit messages.

Example:

REQ-003: implement status endpoint

Before committing:
- review diff
- run relevant tests
- verify no secrets are included

## Skill Mapping

Skills support the engineering workflow. They never replace, skip, or reorder it.

### LOCATE
Preferred skills:
- First Principles Thinking
- pdf:pdf when source artifacts are PDFs
- documents:documents when source artifacts are Word documents

### EXTRACT
Preferred skills:
- First Principles Thinking
- pdf:pdf
- documents:documents
- spreadsheets:Spreadsheets
- visualize:visualize

### CONSTRAIN
Preferred skills:
- First Principles Thinking
- openai-docs when OpenAI technology is involved
- security skills only when security is relevant

### PROMPT
Preferred skills:
- First Principles Thinking
- openai-docs when relevant
- visualize:visualize when system relationships need clarification

GPT may support reasoning, interpretation, and prompt preparation.

### GENERATE
Primary executor:
- Codex

Supporting skills:
- browser:control-in-app-browser when browser interaction is required
- openai-docs when OpenAI integration is involved
- security fix skills only for validated security findings

### REVIEW
Preferred skills:
- First Principles Thinking
- browser:control-in-app-browser
- spreadsheets:Spreadsheets for traceability checks
- security review skills only when security review is relevant

### RECONCILE
Preferred skills:
- First Principles Thinking
- visualize:visualize
- spreadsheets:Spreadsheets
- documents:documents
- pdf:pdf

## Skill Selection Rule

Before invoking a Skill, identify:

1. current workflow stage
2. selected Skill
3. why the Skill is relevant
4. what artifact or evidence it will operate on

If no Skill is necessary, continue without one.

Never invoke a Skill merely because it is available.
